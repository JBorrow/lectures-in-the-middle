<p>To access the notebook exercises go to <a href="https://dmaitre.phyip3.dur.ac.uk/NPP/notebooks/" class="uri">https://dmaitre.phyip3.dur.ac.uk/NPP/notebooks/</a>. You should be greeted by a login screen similar to the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="login.png" alt="image" width="90%"/></p>
<p>Log in with your CIS username and password. Once logged in you should see a list of your files (empty the first time you log in).</p>
<p><img src="loggedin.png" alt="image" width="90%" /></p>
<p>To access the python exercises, go to the “assignments” tab. You should get a list of assignments that are ready for you to download.</p>
<p><img src="assignments.png" alt="image" width="90%" /></p>
<p>To download an assignment, click on the “fetch” button, the assignment will move to the “Downloaded assignments” section. It will also be in a folder in your “files” view after you log in.</p>
<p>Each assignment can contain one or more notebooks, you can see the notebooks for each assignment by clicking on the assignment name in the “Downoaded assignments” section, or navigating to the directory named after the assignment.</p>

<p>By clicking on a notebook in the list this notebook will open for you to edit.</p>
<p><img src="notebook.png" alt="image"  width="90%" /></p>
<p>The notebooks come with some exercises and test to check that your implmentation is correct. The “validate” button in the assignment section will run the notebook and check that all tests pass. Once you are satisfied with your notebook you can submit it to be automatically graded. These “marks” are not summative but can help track your progress. If you submit your work it will be possible to offer some feedback on it. The submission is completely optional.</p>

<p>Notebooks are composed of input, output and text cells. The input cells have “In[ ]” text to their left before they are evaluated. After evaluation a number appears between the bracket. If you see “In[23]” it means that this is the 23th input cell to be evaluated in the session. Similarily output cells have an “Out[]” to their left and the number inside the brackets displays which input cell this is the output of.</p>

<p>The content of the input cells is python code. You can edit the cells by clicking in them or create new cells using the “+” button from the toolbar. To execute the content of the active input cell, press <span>shift+enter</span>. Input cells currently evaluating have a star in the <span>In[]</span> bracket. While a cell is evaluating you can queue more cells for evaluation by pressing <span>shift+enter</span> in them. You cn interupt the evaluation using the “Interrupt” entry in the “Kernel” menu.</p>
<p>Your assignment will usually provide most of the boiler plate code and you will be asked to fill in the intersting parts. Look for “YOUR CODE HERE” in the code to find the places where you are expected to provide some code.</p>
<p><img src="codeToFill.png" alt="image"  width="90%"/></p>
<p>Most parts of the assignment will be followed by testing code that help you check that your code works as expected. The test will take the form of <span>assert</span> statements.</p>

<p>The tool bar at the top of the notebook contains a “validate” button that runs the entire notebook and allows to test that all test pass before you submit your work (if you decide to do so).</p>
