<p class="glossary-key" id="phase-space"> Phase-space </p>
<p class="glossary-desc"><p>The phase-space for a process is the set of all possible kinematical final states energies and momenta the particle in the final state can assume. It is normally the integral over all energies and momenta, subject to the energy-momentum conservation constraints. Let’s consider a few examples.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the decay of a massive particle with spin <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> in its centre of mass system into two massless particles the energy of the daughter particles have to equal to half the mass of the decaying particle. The momentum has to be equal in magnitude to the energy and opposite so that the total momentum is equal to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> (to match the momentum of the decaying particle). So the phase-space can be parametrised in this case with the direction of flight of one of the particles, all other quantities being fixed by the energy-momentum conservation constraints.</p></li>
<li><p>In the discussion of deep inelastic scattering we started with elastic scattering of the electron off the proton. In this case the phase-space has the same type of constraints than in the above example except that now not all particles are massless. We have two energies and momenta for the the electron and recoiled proton, that is 8 parameters. We have four constraints from momentum conservation, and two <a href=#on-shell>on-shell</a> conditions, one for the electron <span class="math inline">\(p_e^2=m_e^2\)</span> and one for the proton <span class="math inline">\(p_p^2=m_p^2\)</span> so that we have two free parameters. One can be taken to be the azimuthal angle around the electron direction. Since this is a symmetry of the system the cross section will not depend on it so we only have one relevant quantity. It can be taken to be the scattering angle <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> or the momentum transfer squared <span class="math inline">\(Q^2=-q^2\)</span>. When we go into the inelastic regime the last constraint on the momentum of the proton is released and we now have two independent quantities, which can be chosen to be either <span class="math inline">\(x,Q^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\nu,\Theta\)</span>.</p></li>
